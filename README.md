This is a little toy to discover which iOS keyboard notifications are sent when. We were particularly interested in what notifications are sent on the iPad during rotation and when using a split or undocked keyboard.

Best used during debugging to let you poke into the info dictionaries on the notifications.

Double tap on the grey background area to insert a `------` line into the log on-screen.
